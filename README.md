# Multiple Angular and React Projects

This workspace was generated using <a href="https://nx.dev" target="_blank">Nx</a>.

You can use <a href="https://angularconsole.com/" target="_blank">Angular Console</a> to serve an application, run tests, lint, build and manage all the applications features.

## Applications

Applications list with their related name for the CLI:

- NG Website (ngwebsite)
- Two Sums (two-sums)
- SEO tools (seo-tools)
- Form validations examples (form-validation)
- Unique IDs in a modal window (uniqueid-modal)
- Angular Components interactions (components-interactions)
- Api and Media aggregator (api-media-aggregator)
- Packagist PHP API made with ReactJS (packagist-api)

## Generate a new application

Run `ng g app <myapp>` to generate an application. When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same CLI workspace.

## Run an application

Run `ng serve <myapp>` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project=myapp` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build <myapp>` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test <myapp>` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e <myapp> --watch` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Use the `--watch` flag to keep Cypress open: when you update a test, Cypress will run the tests again.

## Lint

TSLint is an extensible static analysis tool that checks TypeScript code for readability, maintainability, and functionality errors. 

Run `ng lint <myapp>` to run TSLint on a project.
